    <h2 class="to">Robotics and Automation</h2><br>
    <p class="pi">Robotics is a field of engineering that deal with design and application of robots and the use of computer for their manipulation and processing. Robots are used in industries for speeding up the manufacturing process. They are also used in the field of nuclear science, sea-exploration, servicing of transmission electric signals, designing of bio-medical equipments etc. Robotics requires the application of computer integrated manufacturing, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biological mechanics, software engineering.<br>

Automation and Robotics Engineering is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization.<br>
A specialization in robotics engineering may lead to potential career opportunities in manufacturing, research and engineering, agriculture, mining, nuclear, power-plantmaintenances and a variety of other areas. Besides, thereis great scope for qualified experts and researchers to associate themselves with different segments of R & D in robotics. As the recent global career trend in robotics suggests, fields as diverse as surgery, modern warfare and nanotechnology have registered a remarkable increase recently in their demand for technical expertsand researches in robotics. <p>
